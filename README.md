# Predicting Bus Time Arrivals Across Seattle
Check out [bus.wtf - wait time forecast](http://bus.wtf)! The goal of the project was to provide Seattle bus riders with a bus arrival prediction tool. King County provides a real-time bus location data feed for all their buses via the One Bus Away API. Real-time data works great when you’re hoping to grab a bus in the moment but it’s not helpful for future planning. In addition to bus arrival predictions, this project's aim was also to provide users with insights into the route they use, confirming trends they have experienced, and provide planning insights into routes they are unfamiliar with, giving them insights that only a well-seasoned rider would know.
