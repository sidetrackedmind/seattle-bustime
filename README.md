# Business Understanding
King County provides a real-time bus location data feed for all their buses via the One Bus Away API. This feed is built into many navigation apps to provide the user with real-time bus location/arrival information. Real-time data works great when you’re hoping to grab a bus at that moment but it’s not helpful for future planning. This project's aim is to provide users with insights into the route they use, confirming trends they have experienced, and provide planning insights into routes they are unfamiliar with, giving them insights that only a well-seasoned rider would know.
